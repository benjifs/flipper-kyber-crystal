# Kyber Crystals on the Flipper Zero

## Usage
Move the contents of the [crystals](/crystals) directory to your Flipper under `/SD Card/lfrfid` using [qFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update).

## Troubleshooting
* Crystals have to be placed in a very specific position behind the Flipper Zero to be read correctly. If you are having difficulties, you can try using a spoon around your Kyber Crystal as described here: https://youtu.be/mWSUwQ7S9Ug

## Known Issues
* At this time, the Flipper Zero does not support writing to EM4305
